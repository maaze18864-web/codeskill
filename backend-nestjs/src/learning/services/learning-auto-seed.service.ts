A **Relational Database** organizes data into tables (relations) consisting of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).

#### Key Constraints:
- **Primary Key (PK)**: Uniquely identifies each tuple. Must be \`UNIQUE\` and \`NOT NULL\`.
- **Foreign Key (FK)**: Enforces referential integrity by linking to a Primary Key in another table.
- **Candidate Key**: A minimal superkey that can uniquely identify any tuple.
- **Unique vs Primary Key**: A table can have multiple \`UNIQUE\` keys, but only **one** \`PRIMARY KEY\`. Primary keys forbid \`NULL\` values.

A transaction is a logical unit of work executing database operations:
- **Atomicity**: All or nothing (via undo/redo logs).
- **Consistency**: Preserves database invariants and constraints.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Committed changes survive crashes (via WAL - Write-Ahead Logging).

#### Transaction Isolation Levels & Read Phenomena:

| Isolation Level | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Read Uncommitted** | ❌ Allowed | ❌ Allowed | ❌ Allowed |
| **Read Committed** | ✅ Prevented | ❌ Allowed | ❌ Allowed |
| **Repeatable Read** | ✅ Prevented | ✅ Prevented | ❌ Allowed (prevented in Postgres MVCC) |
| **Serializable** | ✅ Prevented | ✅ Prevented | ✅ Prevented |

#### Two-Phase Locking (2PL):
1. **Growing Phase**: Transaction acquires locks, cannot release any locks.
2. **Shrinking Phase**: Transaction releases locks, cannot acquire any new locks.
- **Strict 2PL**: Holds all exclusive (write) locks until the transaction commits/aborts to prevent cascading rollbacks.

- High fanout ensures tree height rarely exceeds 3 to 4 levels even for millions of rows, minimizing disk I/O.

#### Clustered vs Non-Clustered Indexes:
- **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical ordering of data pages on disk. A table can have **only one** clustered index (usually the Primary Key).

When an SQL engine executes an \`INNER JOIN\`, it chooses one of three primary physical operators:

#### 1. Nested Loop Join:
- For each outer tuple, scan the inner table.
- Best when the outer table is tiny and the inner table has an index on the join key ($O(N \\times \\log M)$).

#### 2. Hash Join:
1. **Build Phase**: In-memory hash table built on the smaller table's join keys.
2. **Probe Phase**: Scan the larger table and probe the hash table.
- Expected time: $O(N + M)$. Highly efficient for large unsorted datasets with equijoins.

#### 3. Sort-Merge Join:
- Sort both relations on the join key, then scan synchronously like two pointers.
- Optimal when tables are already sorted or indexed in sorted order.

      content: `### Distributed Databases & The CAP Theorem

In any distributed data store across a network, network partitions (disconnections) are inevitable.

#### 1. The CAP Theorem (Brewer):
You can guarantee at most **two out of three** properties simultaneously:
- **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error (linearizable).
- **Availability (A)**: Every non-failing node returns a non-error response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: System continues operating despite arbitrary dropped or delayed network messages.

> Since network partitions cannot be prevented in distributed hardware, real-world systems must choose between:
> - **CP Systems** (e.g., PostgreSQL primary-replica sync, MongoDB with majority write concern)
> - **AP Systems** (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB with eventual consistency)

#### 2. ACID vs BASE:
| ACID (Relational) | BASE (NoSQL / Eventual) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A**tomicity | **B**asically **A**vailable |
| **C**onsistency | **S**oft-state |
| **I**solation | **E**ventual consistency |
| **D**urability | High throughput across partitions |

The Java Virtual Machine organizes runtime data into distinct regions:

1. **Heap Memory**:
   - Stores all created objects and instances.
   - Shared across all threads.
   - Managed automatically by the Garbage Collector (GC: Young Gen [Eden, S0, S1] + Old Gen).
2. **Stack Memory**:
   - Stores local primitive variables and references to objects on the heap.
   - Thread-private (each thread has its own stack).
   - Operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method frame basis. Fast allocation and deallocation.
3. **Metaspace (Native Memory)**:
   - Replaced PermGen in Java 8.
   - Stores class metadata, bytecode, static variables, and method tables.
4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**:
   - Tracks the address of the current JVM instruction being executed by a thread.

Streams provide a declarative, functional approach to processing collections.

#### Core Stream Operations:
- **Intermediate Operations** (Lazy):

  - \`.map(Function<T, R>)\`: Transforms elements into another type.
  - \`.sorted()\`: Orders elements.
  - \`.distinct()\`: Removes duplicates.
- **Terminal Operations** (Triggers execution):
  - \`.collect(Collectors.toList())\`: Materializes stream to List.
  - \`.reduce(identity, accumulator)\`: Aggregates elements to single value.
  - \`.forEach(Consumer<T>)\`: Executes action for each element.

#### 1. Number Systems:
- **Binary (Base 2)**: Digits 0, 1.

- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Digits 0–9, A–F (where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15).

#### 2. Two's Complement (Signed Integers):
To represent negative numbers in binary:
1. Write the positive binary number.
2. Invert all bits (1's complement: $0 \\to 1, 1 \\to 0$).
3. Add 1 to the result.

Example for $-5$ in 8-bit:
- $+5 = 00000101_2$
- 1's complement = $11111010_2$
- Add 1 = **$11111011_2$**

#### 3. Primary Logic Gates:
- **AND**: Output 1 only if BOTH inputs are 1.
- **OR**: Output 1 if AT LEAST ONE input is 1.
- **NOT**: Inverts the input.
- **XOR**: Output 1 if inputs are DIFFERENT ($0 \\oplus 1 = 1, 1 \\oplus 1 = 0$).
- **NAND & NOR**: **Universal Gates** because any boolean function can be constructed using only NAND or only NOR gates.

CPU scheduling selects a process from the Ready Queue to execute on the CPU core:

2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Provably optimal minimum average waiting time. Preemptive version is called **SRTF** (Shortest Remaining Time First).
3. **Round Robin (RR)**: Preemptive. Each process receives a fixed **Time Quantum** ($q$). If the process doesn't finish within $q$, it is pre-empted and moved to the back of the queue.

Used for **Deadlock Avoidance** by testing for a **Safe State** before granting any resource request:

#### 1. Paging:
- Memory is split into fixed-size physical blocks called **Frames** and logical program blocks called **Pages**.
- **Page Table**: Translates logical addresses $(p, d)$ into physical addresses $(f, d)$.
- **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**: High-speed hardware associative cache holding recent page-to-frame mappings.
  $$\\text{Effective Access Time (EAT)} = (h \\times (t + m)) + ((1 - h) \\times (t + 2m))$$
  where $h = \\text{TLB hit ratio}, t = \\text{TLB lookup time}, m = \\text{memory access time}$.

#### 2. Page Replacement Algorithms:
When physical memory is full and a page fault occurs:
- **FIFO**: Replaces oldest page. Suffers from **Belady Anomaly** (increasing frame count can increase page faults!).
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the page that has not been referenced for the longest time. Optimal practical policy.
- **Optimal (OPT)**: Replaces page that will not be used for longest future time (theoretical benchmark).
